# S3.8 First Java Game

## Learning Objective
So far, you've had a lot of experience writing fragments of code, but you haven't been asked to put it all together into a stand-alone program. In this project, you're being asked to do just that by putting together what you've learned and making a small coding project of your own! By doing this project, you'll gain the following knowledge:

1. How to write a program from scratch,
2. How to combine learned knowledge and skill to solve a problem,
3. How to set up a development environment and use version control.

## Assignment Description

Starting with the basic template, write your own console-based game in Java. This can be any kind of game, such as hangman, text-based adventure game, number guessing game, etc. The project will need to meet the Completion Criteria as well as follow the Academic Honesty Guidelines presented below. This is an individual project but you're encouraged to consult members of your team as well as the teacher.

### âœ… Completion Criteria

Before you begin, prepare your project:
- [ ] set up a development environment
- [ ] set up a GitHub account and join our GitHub Classroom
- [ ] fork this project in GitHub Classroom

As you work on your project, be sure to:
- [ ] Regularly commit your code to GitHub at the end of every coding session
- [ ] Add comments to your code so that its purpose and functionality are clear

Your game must contain all of the following types of statements:
- [ ] if statements
- [ ] if-else statements
- [ ] else if statements
- [ ] compound boolean expressions
- [ ] comparing objects
- [ ] while loop
- [ ] for loop
- [ ] nested iteration

Also, you need to prepare a short video (1-2 minutes) showing the following:
- [ ] your development environment
- [ ] a demonstration of how your codes works
- [ ] the GitHub project repository with all commits


### ðŸ˜‡ Academic Honesty Guidelines

There are TONS of online tutorials on how to code many simple and sophisticated games in Java. It's appropriate (and even encouraged) that you look over these resources for inspiration as well as coding guidance. Professional developers use Google and Stack Overflow so much it's simply part of their job. All this said, academic dishonesty and plagiarism are still concerns at any school, so to ensure you are on the right path, please follow these guidelines:

1. Research and attribute source - If you use a project or resource heavily, include the URL to the resource in the comments of your code.
2. Copy/paste with care - A good rule of thumb is to avoid copy/pasting more than a line of code at time. It goes without saying that you understand the code you're copy/pasting.
3. Get help, but do your own work - It's encouraged that you get help from other students, but others aren't allowed to work on your project.
4. Commit regularly - At the end of your time coding, commit your code to GitHub so that your changes are recorded.
